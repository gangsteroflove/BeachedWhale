BeachedWhale removes Windows 10 bloatware

BeachedWhale Version 8.0 has a GUI written in Python using the appJar repo.
Check out appJar at: http://appjar.info

This program can remove all of the bloatware applications that come preinstalled and installed without your consent from Windows 10. 
The backend is written in PowerShell scripts to communicate with the OS directly. It's fast, easy to use, and safe.

There are two versions of the program. Version 8.0, which has a front end in python. There is also version 7.1, which is one PowerShell script. It also has a GUI built on Windows Forms. Both perform the same, version 8.0 is just prettier.

Let me know what you think!

You can download it from here on GitHub, or a self-extracting zip from my website.
