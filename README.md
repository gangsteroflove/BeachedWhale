BeachedWhale removes Windows 10 bloatware

BeachedWhale Version 8.0 has a GUI written in Python using the appJar repo.
Check out appJar at: http://appjar.info

This program can remove all of the bloatware applications that come preinstalled and installed without your consent from Windows 10. 
The backend is written in PowerShell scripts to communicate with the OS directly. It's fast, easy to use, and safe.

Let me know what you think!
